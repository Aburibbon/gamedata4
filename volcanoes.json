    "stratovolcanoDefinition": "A conical shaped volcano formed by hundreds of layers of hardened lava and tephra and can be thousands of feet tall. Can produce very explosive eruptions or caldera forming eruptions, similar to Crater Lake during its VEI 7 super eruption.",
    "cinderConeDefinition": "A conical shaped volcano made of loose pyroclastic material. Usually does not last long and goes extinct after its first few eruptions.",
    "shieldDefinition": "A wide, usually short (from sea level), volcano formed similarly to stratovolcanoes, but with very viscous basaltic lava that flows down the mountain. Normally produces effusive eruptions no more than VEI 4.",

            "desc": "A stratovolcano in Washington state that is responsible for the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens that covered most of north Washington in ash along with other states downwind east. The entire north flank of the volcano collapsed right as the eruption begun and caused a massive landslide because of a magnitude 5.1 earthquake directly under the north flank. The eruption was determined to be a VEI 5."
